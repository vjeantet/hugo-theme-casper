## Multiple authors configuration

In addition to providing data for a single author as shown in the example above, multiple authors
can be configured via data/authors/\*.(yml, toml, json) entries. If the key provided in
.Site.Params.author matched a data/authors/\* entry, it will be used as the default. Overrides
per page can be done by a simple author = other_author_key entry in the front matter. For those
pages where you want to omit the author block completely, a .Params.noauthor entry is also
available.

Example author definition file:

``` yml
name: John Doe
bio: The most uninteresting man in the world.
location: Normal, IL
website: http://example.com
thumbnail: images/john.png

```

Example override author per page file:
``` toml
+++
author = ""
date = "2014-07-11T10:54:24+02:00"
title = ""
...
+++

Contents here

```

## Menu configuration

On top right of the screen, a "Subscribe" button is displayed with a link to the RSS feed.

When you define a menu in the main config file, Then a menu button is displayed instead of the subscribe button
When the use clicks the menu button, a sidebar appears and shows the subscribe button and all items defined in the main config file

> :information_source: If your added a metadata like ```menu="main"``` in a content file metadata, it will also be displayed in the main menu

Example of a menu definition in main config file.


``` toml
[[menu.main]]
  name = "My Blog"
  weight = -120
  identifier = "blog"
  url = "/"

[[menu.main]]
  name = "About me"
  weight = -110
  identifier = "about"
  url = "/about"
  
```

## Metadata on each content file, example

``` toml

author = ""
date = "2014-07-11T10:54:24+02:00"
draft = false
title = "dotScale 2014 as a sketch"
